<!-- Things I want to accomplish with this app -->

1. Design cards which display information about coffee beans

2. On that card, either display that key information on the
   main card or have the ability to click on the card to showcase more info

3. Add new coffee or update existing inventory (if bought same beans as before)

4. Deduct wieght from beans when a coffee is made (user would click a button)

   - Maybe make a button and let's user click the card which beans they are using and enter amount of beans used

5. Add custom notes on each coffee bean (what you liked, grind setting, preferred brew method, etc.)

6. Tabs

   - All (showcases all beans)
   - Current (beans that have 'x' amount of weight remaining)
   - Favorite (each card can have a feature to add to a favorite page)

7. Filter / Search through beans (origin, brand, flavor notes, etc.)

8. Maybe use icons to help describe information on the cards

<!-- FRONT OF CARD -->

- The front of the card can display information that does not change (e.g. flavor profiles (notes), origin, roast level, etc)

  - Need a nice way to display the information on that info

- The front will also display necessary information such as the roast date and how much weight remains

<!-- BACK OF CARD -->

- The back will contain a edit button which would allow the user to edit some information on the beans (e.g. grind setting, preferred brewing method, and any other notes they would like to add)
